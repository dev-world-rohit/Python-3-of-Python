# Python-3-of-Python
Today I learn the core concepts of sequential data in python like list, tuple and strings.

## Sequence Tpyes
- sequences	are	ordered collections of objects

## Homogeneous Sequences
- certain	sequence types can only contain	objects	that are all the same type
```
a = [1, 34, 43, 34]
```

## Heterogeneous Sequence
- sequences which contains the different type of objects
```
a = ["abc", 23, 'a', True]
```
**List are mutable whereas tuple and string are immutable**

I also learned all of the important methods used in these sequence data.

## Types of Data Copy
1. Shallow Copy
In shallow copy, new sequence is created but the new sequence reference the same elements as original.
- adding/removing/replacing the element in copy do not afftect the original sequence
- but mutating data will also affect the new sequnce

2. Deep Copy
In deep copy, new sequence is created and each element in new sequence is the deep copy of the original.
- any change is copy sequence will not affect the original sequence.


## Unicode
Today I learned a very interesting thing in the unicode.
